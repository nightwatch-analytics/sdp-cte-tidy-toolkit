# About ----

# The code in this section was converted from Stata to R and refactored to
# adhere to standard tidy methods

# See the first section of code for required libraries and packages. This code
# tested in R version 4.3.3 / Version 2023.12.1+402
# (Latest available in April 2024)

# See the Data Specification Guide for how to structure your data

# Set up ----

# Clear environment
rm(list = ls())

# In the directory where you have the R Project file, ensure there is a folder
# called "data" and a folder called "graphs" or change the names for these
# folders below
data_path <- file.path("data", "cte_sample_data.csv") # set path to your saved .csv data file matching spec document
saved_graphs <- "graphs" # set path (folder) for where you'd like graphs saved on your computer

# Load required packages
# If required packages are not yet installed, uncomment the line below to install them
library(tidyverse)
