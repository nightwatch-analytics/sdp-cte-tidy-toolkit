#   Comments about this code ----

# The code in this section was converted from Stata to R and closely matches 
# the Stata version.

# See the first section of code for required libraries and packages. This code
# tested in R version 4.3.1 / RStudio version 2023.09.0+463 
# (Latest available in October 2023)

# Data for this analysis code should be set up according to the accompanying data 
# specification guide.


# Set up ----

# In the directory where you have the R Project file, ensure there is a folder 
# called "data" and a folder called "graphs" or change the names for these
# folders below
data_path <- file.path("data", "cte_sample_it_courses.csv") # set path to your saved .csv data file matching spec document
saved_graphs <-	"graphs" # set path (folder) for where you'd like graphs saved on your computer

# Load packages ----
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

# Import ----

cte_course_data <- read_csv(data_path)

# Visualize ----
# Plotly Scatterplot with tooltip hover 

# Add column to be passed to color argument
cte_course_data <- cte_course_data %>% 
  mutate(color_val = "constant")

# Note: In the general technical guide, the Stata example shows how to create
# multiple charts at the same time, one for each pathway. The example data used
# here does not contain multple pathways (IT only), so only the IT pathway courses
# are shown.

# Round proportion_failing, prob_completer_pass, prob_completer_fail, prob_completer_diff 
# for better display

  mutate(proportion_failing = round(proportion_failing, 2),
