# Comments about this code ----

# The code in this section was converted from Stata to R and closely matches 
# the Stata version.

# See the first section of code for required libraries and packages. This code
# tested in R version 4.3.1 / RStudio version 2023.09.0+463 
# (Latest available in October 2023)

# Data for this analysis code should be set up according to the accompanying data 
# specification guide.

# Set up ----

# In the directory where you have the R Project file, ensure there is a folder 
# called "data" and a folder called "graphs" or change the names for these
# folders below
data_path <- file.path("data", "cte_sample_credits.csv") # set path to your saved .csv data file matching spec document
saved_graphs <-	"graphs" # set path (folder) for where you'd like graphs saved on your computer

# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)

# Import ----

cte_credit_data <- read_csv(data_path)

# Generate an entry pathway code for each student
